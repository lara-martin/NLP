## Learning Objectives
In this assignment, you will
- take a stance on an AI topic and back it up with evidence from research
- find and summarize reputible research articles

## Instructions
- Find a topic of interest in recent news related to AI. You don't need a specific news article to draw from; it can just be something you heard. However, if you can find an article, it might give you a more concrete starting point.
- Present your stance. Do you agree? Disagree? Agree only in certain conditions?
- Back up your stance using research articles.
  - Find 3 reputible research articles that back up your stance or refute opposing views.
  - Summarize each article and tie it into your argument.


### Generative AI Policy

If you use ChatGPT (or similar chatbots or AI-based generation tools), you must describe exactly how you used it, including providing the prompt, the original generation, and your edits. This applies to prose, code, or any form of content creation. Not disclosing is an academic integrity violation. If you do disclose, your answer may receive anywhere from 0 to full credit, depending on the extent of substantive edits, achievement of the [learning objectives](#learning-objectives), and overall circumvention of those objectives.

Use of AI/automatic tools for grammatical assistance (such as spell-checkers or Grammarly) or small-scale predictive text (e.g., next word prediction, tab completion) is okay. Provided the use of these tools does not change the substance of your work, use of these tools may be, but is not required to be, disclosed.


## Grading
- You will get 2 points on your final grade if you follow all of these grading criteria:
  - Report is well-written and easy to follow.
  - Articles that are cited are 1) from highly-cited conferences or journals and 2) cited correctly. You have at least 3 articles you cite.
  - Articles are constructive to your argument and summarized well.
- You will lose 0.5 points for every component above that is missed or not completed sufficiently.
- You will get 0.5 points if you give the assignment a solid effort but neglect the 3 grading criteria.
